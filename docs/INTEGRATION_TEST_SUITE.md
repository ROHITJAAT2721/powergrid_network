- ✅ Cross-contract deployment readiness
- ✅ Integration test framework setup

### 8. Cross-Contract Functionality (📊)
- ✅ Cross-contract dependency compilation
- ✅ Shared type system validation
- ✅ Inter-contract communication setup

### 9. Code Quality Validation (🔍)
- ✅ Clippy linting across all contracts
- ✅ Warning-free compilation
- ✅ Code style consistency

### 10. Documentation Validation (📋)
- ✅ Documentation completeness
- ✅ README files presence
- ✅ API documentation generation

### 11. Deployment Readiness (🚀)
- ✅ Release mode compilation
- ✅ Contract size analysis
- ✅ Production deployment validation

## Usage

```bash
# Run complete test suite
./scripts/complete-integration-test.sh

# Run with timeout for CI environments
timeout 300 ./scripts/complete-integration-test.sh
```

## Test Results

The script provides:
- **Real-time progress** with colored output
- **Detailed test results** for each validation step
- **Comprehensive summary** showing pass/fail counts
- **Actionable error messages** for any failures

## Output Format

## Integration with Development Workflow

This script validates:

1. **Development Environment**: Ensures all tools are properly installed
2. **Code Quality**: Validates compilation, tests, and linting
3. **Build Process**: Confirms all contracts build successfully
4. **Testing Coverage**: Verifies unit, integration, and e2e test frameworks
5. **Deployment Readiness**: Ensures production builds work correctly

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests all aspects of the development pipeline
- **Colored Output**: Easy-to-read progress and results
- **Error Isolation**: Identifies specific failure points
- **Performance Metrics**: Shows build times and artifact sizes
- **CI/CD Ready**: Suitable for automated validation pipelines

## Success Criteria

The test suite passes when:
- All environment tools are available
- All contracts compile without errors
- All unit tests pass
- All integration tests pass
- E2E framework compiles successfully
- No clippy warnings
- Documentation builds successfully
- Release mode compilation works

This ensures the PowerGrid Network is ready for production deployment with full confidence in code quality and functionality.
