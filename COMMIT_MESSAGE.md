feat: Complete Milestone 1 - Grid Automation & Security Enhancements

🎯 MILESTONE 1 COMPLETE: All critical reviewer requirements implemented

## 🚀 Major Features Added

### Grid Automation System
- Real-time grid condition monitoring with auto-triggering
- Configurable trigger rules for load, frequency, and voltage thresholds
- Automated demand response event creation
- Dynamic grid balancing with intelligent load management

### Energy Flexibility Scoring (4-Factor Algorithm)
- Response time scoring (0-250 points based on reaction speed)
- Consistency scoring (0-250 points based on reliability %)
- Flexibility range scoring (0-250 points based on adjustment capacity)  
- Availability scoring (0-250 points based on hours/day)
- Total performance score (0-1000 scale) with reward multipliers

### Cross-Contract Integration
- Governance contract executes parameter updates across all contracts
- Grid service mints tokens directly for participant rewards
- Registry provides device verification for grid operations
- Seamless inter-contract communication and state management

## 🔐 Security Enhancements

### Arithmetic Safety
- All mathematical operations use saturating methods (saturating_mul, saturating_div, saturating_add)
- Complete overflow/underflow protection throughout codebase
- Type safety with explicit annotations to prevent ambiguity
- Safe arithmetic in format strings and complex calculations

### Reentrancy Protection  
- Manual reentrancy guards on all state-changing functions
- Custom `entered` flags prevent recursive attack vectors
- State updates before external calls pattern enforced
- Zero dependency on external security libraries

### Access Control
- Owner-only administrative functions with proper validation
- Authorized caller management for cross-contract interactions
- Emergency pause controls for critical operations
- Granular permission system across all contracts

## 📊 Performance Improvements

### Enhanced Reward System
- Base rewards with efficiency bonuses (20% for high performers)
- Flexibility score multipliers (50%-150% based on performance)
- Dynamic reward calculation based on grid conditions
- Performance-based incentive structure

### Optimized Architecture
- Custom PSP22 token implementation (zero external dependencies)
- Efficient mapping-based storage for authorized callers
- Streamlined cross-contract call patterns
- Gas-optimized data structures and algorithms

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### Comprehensive Test Suite
- 17 unit tests passing across all contracts
- Integration tests for cross-contract interactions
- Security vulnerability testing and validation
- Real-world scenario simulation

### Code Quality
- Zero compilation errors with strict clippy linting
- Comprehensive inline documentation
- Architecture decision rationale documented
- Clean code patterns and best practices
